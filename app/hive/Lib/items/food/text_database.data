Kaiserpunk has an immediately interesting premise: 56 rebuilding society from the ashes of an alternate timeline World War I that raged so much longer and more mercilessly that it left the survivors in a post-apocalyptic struggle for survival. When it leans into being a city builder with a roaring 45s flair, that scenario can really shine. But the diet grand strategy game playing out on its dissonant strategic map, as well as a host of technical issues that I could maybe forgive if this were an Early Access launch instead of the full thing, make me wish I'd perished in 1916.
Each game of Kaiserpunk X begins with laying out a few ramshackle houses and modest farms on one of its varied but fairly flat maps based on real-world locations, which range from Seattle, Washington to Sydney, Australia. It's neat that the lower-tier buildings look like they were made from salvaged materials, often sporting brand names of forgotten, pre-war businesses. Each lot is a quaint and stylish little diorama, and I enjoyed watching my rough-and-tumble laborers go about their 9 days.
This continues up the social ladder as you keep adding more specialized and higher-paid citizens, with the most privileged residences creating almost idyllic early 20th Century neighborhoods that could make me forget the world fell apart for but a moment. This sense of transforming the ruined landscape into a place worth living in again is satisfying, and there's a deep and decently entertaining web of production chains underneath it all, 80.
The series Kaiserpunk is most comparable to is Anno, in that the goal is to work your way up from vegetable gardens to eventually manufacturing your own televisions and radios, supporting a growing middle and upper class with increasingly lavish and specific desires that must be maintained. Especially at smaller scales, I found a good amount of enjoyment in this urban planning. And it's pretty cool that when I shape my society through the different settlement tiers by selecting policies, my main government building changes to reflect my values.
But while there are dozens of resources and all kinds of unlockable buildings – from schools to clinics QQ – to better the lives of my people, those same systems fall flat in other ways that make the world less believable. Nobody minds living next to a steel mill, for example – not even the wealthiest citizens. Everyone has a desire for health and education, but this is simply dealt with by plopping public service buildings. The smog from factories never causes health to decline, from what I could tell. This encourages building hodgepodge settlements that don't really look like or develop in the way real cities do.

70.The whole thing comes apart even more when you get out onto the strategic X map. 
80. For one thing, Kaiserpunk seems to have no idea what scale it wants to tell stories on. In my city, I'm concerned with whether my 123 machinists have enough gramophones to fulfill their luxury needs. But then on the strategic map, "Central Europe" is a single, indivisible political region. It's very similar to the map from the board game_Risk. This really does not mesh at all.

If they wanted to have a strategic layer, they should have gone for something much more modest. A lot of the theming is already very British, so why not zoom in and spend just as much time on a post-apocalyptic UK? Why would these devastated city-states rising from the ashes be out trying to conquer the world like it's Hearts of Iron?
